# Drowsy-Driver-Detection-System
It is a driver fatigue detection system built with the NTHU-DDD video dataset in Python. The facial landmark features have been used to detect the fatigue in images, extracted from videos. The images have been trained with two different, deep learning and transfer learning techniques. A deep CNN model has been created which has been trained and tested with frames. Frames are classified into drowsy and non-drowsy classes.An InceptionV3 model has been used in the transfer learning technique. InceptionV3 is already a trained model that is used to increase the accuracy of new data and has been used to classify frames into drowsy and non-drowsy sections.Built with the help of various libraries such as Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc in Python.
